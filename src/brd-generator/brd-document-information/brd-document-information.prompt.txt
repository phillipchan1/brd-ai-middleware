### Template Overview

This document template is designed to facilitate the process of recording business requirements derived from project sponsor and stakeholders, and system users.

&lt;Italicized text in angle brackets, like this, provides instructions to the template user. It should be removed and, where appropriate, be replaced with the requested content.&gt;

In select places, the template provides text for the document. This text should be augmented, expanded, and edited as appropriate.

Additionally, this document is both a template as well as a set of instructions. It should be noted that business requirements and the associated processes can be used as input into automated data capture tools such as Micro Focus ALM Octane, UMT360 and Micro Focus ALM (Application Lifecycle Management). Where applicable, this template will provide specific instructions on how to input data into these tools. However, Section 1 of this document is always required, regardless of automated data capture tool(s) used to supplement.

Instructions related to these tools are informative and will be called out using the following form:

**_Examples:_**

**Octane:** _In the ALM Octane banner, click the menu button and select Dashboard or select the Overview tab in the Backlog/Quality modules._

**UMT360:** _Go to Project Online and add a Content Editor web part to each PDP that does not require a mapping with UMT360 Forms._

The business requirements in this document are captured at two points during the System/Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Initially section one of this document a) should be completed as the customer initially describes his/her need and b) becomes the foundation for the ROM Estimate required for the IT Op Plan Governance Gate. The subsequent sections of this document should be completed during Solution Analysis and will form the basis for the more formalized requirements, design traceability and Step 2/Solution Implementation funding. It is recommended that you become familiar with the [SDLC Integrated Workstream](https://edisonintl.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/itprocess/Guidelines/SDLC%20Integrated%20Workstream.pdf?csf=1&e=7fHG4G) and [SDLC Core Document Tree by Function](https://edisonintl.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/teams/itprocess/Guidelines/SDLC%20Core%20Document%20Tree%20by%20Function.vsdx?d=w944f1314d9b7400196108445087bd139&csf=1&e=Okx2l8) diagrams.

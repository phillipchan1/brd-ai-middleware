# User Stories/Features

<A [user story](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/) is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or stakeholder of the system. They typically follow a simple template: As a &lt;type of user&gt;, I want &lt;some goal&gt; so that &lt;some reason&gt;.

**Example:** As a user, I can back up my entire hard drive so that I can recover from any data loss.

**Example:** As a power user, I can specify files or folders to back up based on file size, date created and date modified, so that I only back up important data and don’t waste backup space.>

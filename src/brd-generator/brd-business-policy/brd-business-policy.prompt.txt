## Business Policies & Rules

<A business policy is a plan or course of action intended to influence and determine decisions, actions and other matters. Policies are implemented to avoid some negative effect or to seek some positive benefit.

Business rules are declarations of policies or conditions that must be satisfied and are intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business. They are constraints on a person, business, element of the business, or action performed; they are a type of business requirement.>
